## Project Description

This project is a simulation of an advanced online store developed using C++. It provides features such as dynamic shopping cart, inventory management, discount calculations, and transaction history management. The goal is to demonstrate advanced programming concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data validation, and user-friendly graphical interfaces.

## Features

### Features Implemented
- Product Inventory Management:
  - Add, edit, and delete product details.
  - Display product availability and status (e.g., in stock, out of stock).
- Dynamic Shopping Cart:
  - Real-time price updates based on inventory changes or discounts.
  - Calculate the final price with discounts applied.
- Discount Calculations:
  - Apply discounts based on product quantity or purchase amount.
  - Support for promotional and coupon codes.
- Transaction History:
  - Store order details for future reference.
  - Display past orders with their respective statuses.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI):
  - User-friendly interface created using Qt.
  - Menu options for viewing products, adding items to the cart, and checking out.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler supporting modern C++ standards.
- Qt Framework for GUI development.
- Optional: SQLite for data storage if database integration is required.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   
   `
   git clone https://github.com/nooshinghobadi/Online-Store
   `
   
   `
   cd Online-Store
   `
   
3. Compile the project using your preferred C++ compiler and Qt environment.

4. Run the executable to start the application.
